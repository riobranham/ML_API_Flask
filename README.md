# ML API w/ Flask, AWS and Docker

This repo has code for a basic example of setting up an API endpoint for calling predictions from a pre-built
random forest ML model using Flask, Docker and AWS.

It uses the boston housing dataset from Sci-kit Learn as data for the model.

The goal is to help people put their machine learning models into a production environment where predictions can 
be made on the fly with new data

Tutorial that I followed to set this up is [here.]
